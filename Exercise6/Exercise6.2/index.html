                <p class="card-text">The @property rule in CSS enhances the functionality of custom properties (CSS variables) by allowing developers to define their syntax, initial values, and inheritance behavior. This feature enables smoother animations and transitions by giving the browser detailed information about the property's expected data type and default behavior.</p>
                <p>With @property, you can create dynamic, interactive effects that previously required more complex JavaScript code, making it easier to handle animations directly in CSS. This addition marks a significant step forward in CSS's ability to manage advanced styles, especially as browser support continues to grow, enabling more efficient and visually engaging web designs. Newly added also in Firefox so now widely supported!</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Subgrid</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The subgrid feature is an extension of the CSS Grid layout that allows a grid item to inherit the track sizes from its parent grid. This capability enables more precise alignment between nested elements, ensuring that layouts are consistent without needing additional calculations or hacks. Subgrid is particularly useful for aligning content in complex grid-based designs where the alignment of child elements needs to match their siblings across different sections of the layout.</p>
